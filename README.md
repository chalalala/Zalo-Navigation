# Week 4 - Zalo Navigation
We're going to clone Zalo. Our app will help users see a lot of unique content based on what it is they're looking for. This will require the use of a library called **React Navigation** that comes with **Expo**.

- User can see information about the user whose message they pressed on arriving at the Conversation screen.
- User can see an icon on the Messages screen which when pressed, opens a Drawer.
